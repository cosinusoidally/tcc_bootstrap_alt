This is a JS port of tcc_1_7. Easiest way to run is via node.js is from the
parent directory ie:

cd ..
./mk_tcc_js

This port runs under Spidermonkey, node.js and Duktape. Note currently you need
node.js to actually output the binary to disk. When running under other js VMs
it will compile into memory and then check the sha256sum is the known correct
value.

To run the tests:

./run_test.sh

You will notice that test9 will fail. To fix that you will need a copy of
tcc_boot.o for test9.c that has been built with tcc_1_7. To build that:

cd ..
./mk_min
cd tcc_js
../tcc_1_7/a.out -r test9.c

When tcc_1_7 is run with the -r flag it will run the c file, but also dump a
compiled version of the c file called tcc_boot.o (hadcoded filename, this is an
adhoc executable format).

The reason test9.js will fail without tcc_boot.o is because it will attempt to
compare the real tcc_boot.o with the in memory version generated by the js
version of tcc.
