This is a JS port of tcc_1_7. Easiest way to run is via node.js is from the
parent directory ie:

cd ..
./mk_tcc_js

This port runs under Spidermonkey, node.js and Duktape. Note currently you need
node.js to actually output the binary to disk. When running under other js VMs
it will compile into memory and then check the sha256sum is the known correct
value.
