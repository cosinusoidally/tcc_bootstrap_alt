The aim here is to provide an alternative bootstrap path for
https://github.com/cosinusoidally/mishmashvm/ to allow us to bootstrap tcc
without relying on an Emscripten compiled JS version of JS. This bootstrap
method goes from an adapted tcc 0.9.2 (circa 2001) all the way up to tcc 0.9.27
(the most recent official release from 2017).

Setup:

Follow the Linux setup instruction from
https://github.com/cosinusoidally/mishmashvm/ in order to set up an Ubuntu
bionic chroot, but debootstrap a buildd rather than a minbase:

sudo debootstrap --arch=i386 --variant=buildd bionic bionic
