cc_x86_min.M1 is a cut down version of cc_x86.M1 that is able to be used as an
alternative path to bootstrap M2_simple_asm.c . Couple of stats:

m2min$ ls -l artifacts/cc_x86_min.exe
-rwx------ 1 foo foo 5345 May  4 15:51 artifacts/cc_x86_min.exe

m2min$ ls -l ../x86/bin/cc_x86
-rwx------ 1 foo foo 14239 May  4 15:50 ../x86/bin/cc_x86

As you can see the cc_x86_min.exe binary is considerably smaller than the
cc_x86 binary.

m2min$ wc cc_x86_min.M1
 2430  8858 91918 cc_x86_min.M1

m2min$ wc ../x86/cc_x86.M1
  4983  19179 209318 ../x86/cc_x86.M1

(note these numbers will likely drift out of sync, run mk_simple_asm_cc_x86_min
to get the latest ones).

You can also see that cc_x86_min.M1 is less than half the size of cc_x86.M1 .
This was achieved by cutting it down to only support the M2_simple_asm.c dialect
of C. The code genator has also been tweaked to generate output fairly similar
to M2_simple_asm.

cc_x86 is based off:
https://github.com/oriansj/stage0/tree/master/stage2/High_level_prototypes/cc_x86
but M2_simple_asm.c is also a useful reference too. You'll notice the
similarities with function names and in the general structure.

Internal calling convention:
============================

Note I am referring to the internal calling convention of the assembly
implementation itself rather than the calling convention of the code that it
generates. When reading cc_x86_min.M1 code you will notice the following general
register usage:

EAX this is used as a scratch register, the first arguments to functions, and
    also as the return value from functions

EBX generally used as the 2nd argument to a functions
EDX used as 3rd argument
ESI 4th arg
EBP 5th arg

Registers (other than EAX) are callee saved (ie in the called function itself
you will see the registers being saved at the start of the function and then
restored at the end).

This approach has pros and cons. On the plus side it is probably generating
shorter code as there is less stack juggling, but on the negative side I find it
harder to mentally keep track of where are variable is. I also find it confusing
during function calls as it's not obvious at the call site how many arguments
are being passed.

Random notes:
=============
No hold string so it will just allocate MAX_STRING bytes per token (I set
MAX_STRING to 256).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I moved all the strings to the end of the file since this allows me to more
easily disasseble the whole file using gdb. Note objdump seems to struggle with
cc_x86_min.exe so instead I had to try the following gdb script:

starti
set disassembly-flavor intel
disassemble /r $eip,+6000
quit

It's then a case of manually crossreferencing cc_x86_min.M1 and the output from
gdb

command is something like this:

gdb -batch -x script.gdb artifacts/cc_x86_min.exe > /tmp/blah/cc.dis

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOKEN_LIST structure now has named fields:

        ;; Struct TOKEN_LIST format: (size 16)
        ;; NEXT => 0
DEFINE f_NEXT 00
        ;; LOCALS/PREV => 4
DEFINE f_LOCALS 04
DEFINE f_PREV 04
        ;; S => 8
DEFINE f_S 08
        ;; ARGS/DEPTH => 12
DEFINE f_ARGS 0C
DEFINE f_DEPTH 0C

We then have stuff like this

        LOAD32_ECX_from_ECX_Immediate8 f_ARGS       ; function->args

This also allowed me to change the structure layout without having to change all
users of the struct.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should experiment with alternative calling conventions with cc_x86_min to see if
it is possible to make the assembly a bit clearer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Try adding local variables to cc_x86_min eg

:foo
DEFINE LOCAL_a FC (or whatever the offset is)
reserve_stack_space

and then later on:

local LOCAL_a load

Similar to how M2_simple_asm.c does things, but maybe keep the offsets 8 bits
to keep the code size down (though this is not a hard requirement).

This goes hand in hand with an alternative calling convention since we would
also modify things to make heavier use of the stack (for the above to work we
would also need a frame setting up).

To locate dead code you can sprinkle in INT_03 calls
