Alternative bootstrap path using a heavily cut down version of M2-Planet rather
than cc_x86. The cut down version of M2-Planet is called M2_simple_asm.c . This
cut down version supports a very small subset of C (no operators other than =,
simple expressions only, no structs, enums, etc etc, more complete description
of this subset further down).

Building:
========

In the parent directory run:

./mk_otccelf

This runs the full tcc bootstrap path, but it also generates some files/tools
that we depend on.

Next run:

./mk_simple_asm_self

in the m2min directory.
