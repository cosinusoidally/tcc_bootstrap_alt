Alternative bootstrap path using a heavily cut down version of M2-Planet rather
than cc_x86. The cut down version of M2-Planet is called M2_simple_asm.c . This
cut down version supports a very small subset of C (no operators other than =,
simple expressions only, no structs, enums, etc etc, more complete description
of this subset further down).

Building:
========

In the parent directory run:

./mk_otccelf

This runs the full tcc bootstrap path, but it also generates some files/tools
that we depend on.

Next run:

./mk_simple_asm_self

in the m2min directory. This will use M2_simple_asm.M1 to rebuild itself by
rebuilding M2_simple_asm.c (plus simple_support_m2.c). The resulting binary
(artifacts/M2_simple_asm_m2.exe) is then used to build a copy of otccelf. The
bootstrap process builds bit identical copies of M2_simple_asm.M1 and otccelf.
This can be verified using the following alternative paths:

./mk_simple_asm (builds M2_simple_asm.M1 from M2_simple_asm.c using both tcc
                 and gcc)
./mk_simple_asm_cc_x86 (builds using cc_x86)

mk_simple_asm_self only depends on the availability of hex2 and M0 (which are
built by mk_otccelf and deposited in ../x86/bin/)
