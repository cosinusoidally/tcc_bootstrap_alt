TODO list:

Critical:
- optimize slightly bound checking when doing addition + dereference.
- better section generator (suppress some mmaps).
- To check: bound checking and float/long long/struct copy code
- To check: 'sizeof' may not work if too complex expression is given.
- fix bound check code with '&' on local variables (currently done
  only for local arrays).

Not critical:

- add PowerPC or ARM code generator and improve codegen for RISC (need
  to suppress VT_LOCAL and use a base register instead).
- interactive mode / integrated debugger
- fix multiple compound literals inits in blocks (ISOC99 normative
  example - only relevant when using gotos! -> must add boolean
  variable to tell if compound literal was already initialized).
- add more bounds checked functions (strcpy, ...)
- fix L"\x1234" wide string case (need to store them as utf8 ?)
- fix preprocessor symbol redefinition
- better constant opt (&&, ||, ?:)
- add ELF executable and shared library output option (would be needed
  for completness!).
- D option with all #define cases (needs C parser)
- add portable byte code generator and interpreter for other
  unsupported architectures.
