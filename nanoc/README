The nanoc dialect of C
======================

The idea is to create the simplest subset of C that can still reasonably be used
to bootstrap more complete C compliers (and then all the way up to tcc).

For the standard bootstrap path we use the early stages of stage0-posix-x86.
Basically we do:

hex0 -> hex1 -> hex2 -> M0 -> cc_x86

hex0 is a "compiler" for commented hex dumps
hex1 is a compiler for commented hex dumps with 1 character labels
hex2 is a compiler for commented hex dumps with support for any length labels
M0 is a simple macro assembly language that can be used to implement a simple
assembler. It outputs hex2 code.
cc_x86 is a C compiler written in the M1 macro assembly language (M0 can
assemble this code, M0 is just a simplified implememntation of M1).
