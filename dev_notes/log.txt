ok today I think I will strip down tcc 0.9.3 (1st bootstrap version). To do this
I have taken a backup copy of tcc_3 (tcc_3_orig). I will then make changes to
tcc_3. The reason I have done this is because I may bootstrap from tcc_3 to
tcc_3_orig and then onto tcc_10

Tasks:

rip out all bcheck stuff from tcc_3
rip out all signal handling stuff
rip out debug stuff
rip out buggy and broken elf generation code

write main README for this repo
