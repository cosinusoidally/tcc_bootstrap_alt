hmm, I totally forgot to keep this log up to date. Got this into a working state
a few months back. See main README.

ok today I think I will strip down tcc 0.9.3 (1st bootstrap version). To do this
I have taken a backup copy of tcc_3 (tcc_3_orig). I will then make changes to
tcc_3. The reason I have done this is because I may bootstrap from tcc_3 to
tcc_3_orig and then onto tcc_10

Tasks:

rip out all bcheck stuff from tcc_3
rip out all signal handling stuff
rip out debug stuff
rip out buggy and broken elf generation code

write main README for this repo

Notes:

Note 1:
build_exe
The idea here is to add a custom output executable format. I will then add code
to load this custom format into Spidermonkey via js-ctypes. That way I can
avoid the need to add a full elf writer to tcc_3.
