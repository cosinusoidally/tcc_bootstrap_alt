In M2_simple_asm.c there is a line like this:
int ch = 123;
That needs fixing so "int ch" is hoisted to the top of function:

int ch;
....
ch = 123;

Noticed this when trying to compile it with gcc 2.95 on slackware 8.1

Yes, writing this bug entry is taking longer than actually fixing the bug.
I just can't be bothered fixing atm and I wanted to make a note so I don't
forget.

Incidentally all the stage0 tools are broken on slackware 8.1. They just
segfault. Maybe to do with the 2.4 kernel. iirc it does work on a 2.6 kernel.
I wonder if it's something to do with:

hex1 and hex2 write outside declared ELF memory #1
