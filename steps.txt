WIP documenting the bootstrap process.

This documents the bootstrap process. Essentially this is an English description
of what ./mk_from_bootstrap_seed does in order to go from nothing all the way up
to tcc-0.9.27.

Build kaem-optional-seed and hex0-seed
======================================

The early stages of the boostrap use the early stages of stage0-posix:

https://github.com/oriansj/stage0-posix

Specifically it uses a partial in-tree copy of stage0-posix-x86

stage0 starts with 2 binary artifacts:

hex0-seed - a commented hex dump to binary converter
kaem-optional-seed - a very simple command interpreter

I do not include the binary artifacts. I instead convert them from source to
binary using my ./mk_seeds script. The ./mk_seeds script uses a couple of
simple unix utilites to convert x86/hex0_x86.hex0 into hex0-seed and
x86/kaem-minimal.hex0 into kaem-optional-seed
